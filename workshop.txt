description=Money makes your stronker (Every bill will increase max carry weight by 0.0002)

description=
description=The max roll is 55, the game will roll a number between 0 and 55.

description=--You get +1 dollar to every roll unless you get nothing.
description=--Your rolls always have +4 (eg, if you roll 1, the value changes to a 5)
description=

description=[h1]What is included/changed?[/h1]
description=The main addition is the ability to merge money into consolidated stacks, which addresses some lag-related issues. The merged stacks are also fully 3D modeled, and gives you a slight bonus to the weight reduction. Also changed the changes to only affects "Money" instead of "Base.Money".
description=
description=A money stack costs 50 money - provides -0.012 weight.
description=A money block costs 200 money - provides -0.052 weight.
description=A money tower costs 800 money - provides -0.216 weight.
description=
description=Additional recipes allow you merge and split stacks as you please.
description=
description=If only the ability to consolidate money is desired, there is an extension mod that will remove the bonus. Additionally, if Tile Fixes is enabled, there is an optional extension that allows you to withdraw money from ATMs by using Credit Cards.

description=The logic for using Credit Cards is similar to wallets, but higher probability of getting larger amounts of Money.

description=Currently you can get 1-300 dollars, but higher amounts are more likely than with wallets.

description=--Your rolls always have +10 (eg, if you roll 1, the value changes to an 11)
description=--You can be extremely lucky and get up to 500 dollars.
